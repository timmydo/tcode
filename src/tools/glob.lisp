Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns. When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful."
